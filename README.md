# Juan D. Vega's personal website

## About

This personal page is the first deliverable in the course ISIS 3710 (Programming with Web Technologies) of Los Andes University (Colombia). It includes a brief description of who I am, things I like, projects and experience.

## Objective

Start my journey in web development through a personal web page where fundamental concepts and best practices of structuring and styling are applied.

## Technologies

This web page was developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and associated libraries (Bootstrap and JQuery).

## Deployment

In order to display this web page in your browser, just go to the URL [jd-vega11.github.io] (https://jd-vega11.github.io/)

Otherwise, if you want to do it locally, you need an HTTP server. I recommend you the following: [http-server] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) To use it, please, follow the steps indicated below.

1. Clone this repo
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/)
3. From the command prompt:
  `npm install http-server -g`
4. Go to the project's directory and run the following command:
  `http-server`
5. Open the URL that appears in console.
